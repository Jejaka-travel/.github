# About JEJAKa

**JEJAKa** is an exciting application that provides recommendations for places to visit. It is currently in the development phase as part of the Capstone project by Team C23-PS477, consisting of six developers from Bangkit Academy Cohort, who are actively participating in the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka independent study program. This project is part of **Batch 4 of the <a href="https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/?tab=machine-learning" title="Grow with Google" target="_blank"><b>Bangkit Academy Program</b></a>**

<br>

## Background

Reporting from the  <a href="https://indonesia.go.id/" title="Website indonesia.go.id" target="_blank"><b>indonesia.go.id</b></a> website in one of its articles states that Indonesia's tourism ranking rose rapidly in 2022, namely to 32nd place, up 12 ranks in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI). This shows a significant increase in visitors in Indonesia. Based on this, we created the Jejaka application project to make it easier for tourists to find out the attractions to be visited along with the culture of each tourist destination. In addition, we also use the method of tourist attraction recommendation system based on the closest location of the user. In the search for attractions we add recommendations for the nearest Lodging, Restaurant, Culture and Hospital, so that this application can provide more detailed information, provide a sense of practicality and safety to users in traveling. This application is made in detail and packaged concisely so that users can use this application easily and precisely.
